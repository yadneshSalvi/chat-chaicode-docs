      "# Introduction to HTML\n",
      "HTML is the foundation of all websites. In this guide, you‚Äôll understand the essentials of HTML and get started with web development.\n",
      "## What is HTML?\n",
      "HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It‚Äôs the standard markup language for creating and structuring web pages. HTML defines the structure and content of your web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.\n",
      "## What is HTML5?\n",
      "**HTML5** is the latest version of HTML. It introduces new tags, attributes, and features, making it simpler and more efficient to build modern, interactive web pages. HTML5 is also designed to be fully backward compatible with previous HTML versions.\n",
      "## How much HTML should you learn?\n",
      "You only need the basics of HTML to start creating websites. Typically, mastering HTML essentials should not take more than a weekend. Understand the core tags and structure, and you‚Äôre all set to build web pages effectively.\n",
      "## Text/Code Editor vs. Word Processor\n",
      "  * **Text editors** are specialized tools for writing and editing plain text files, including source code. They include essential features for coding such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and code formatting.\n",
      "  * **Word processors** like Microsoft Word or Google Docs are ideal for creating formatted documents such as letters, reports, or presentations‚Äîbut they‚Äôre not suitable for coding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For HTML development, always use a **code editor**.\n",
      "## Recommended Code Editors\n",
      "Here are some recommended code editors for writing HTML efficiently:\n",
      "  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ‚Äì Powerful, widely-used, and beginner-friendly.\n",
      "  * [Zed](https://zed.dev/) ‚Äì Fast and collaborative editor for modern development.\n",
      "  * **VIM** ‚Äì Highly customizable and efficient (but notoriously tricky to exit!).\n",
      "  * **Helix** ‚Äì Similar to VIM, but easier to use right out of the box.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Essential VS Code Extensions for HTML\n",
      "Enhance your HTML coding experience with these recommended VS Code extensions:\n",
      "  * **HTML Snippets** ‚Äì Quickly insert common HTML structures.\n",
      "  * **Live Server** ‚Äì Automatically refreshes your browser as you edit your HTML.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Emmet for HTML Productivity\n",
      "Emmet is built-in with VS Code and allows you to rapidly generate HTML code using short abbreviations. This significantly speeds up your coding workflow. No need to manually type lengthy tags‚Äîlet Emmet handle it for you.\n",
      "Spend some time getting familiar with Emmet shortcuts to greatly improve your productivity. Learn more about Emmet at the [official website](https://emmet.io/).\n",

      "<imgsrc=\"image.jpg\"alt=\"Descriptive image text\">\n",
      "<ahref=\"https://www.google.com\">Visit Google</a>\n",
      "<inputtype=\"text\"placeholder=\"Enter your name\">\n",
      "<button>Click me</button>\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "  * `id=\"my-id\"` - Adds an `id` attribute with the value `my-id`\n",
      "  * `.my-class` - Adds a `class` attribute with the value `my-class`\n",
      "  * `src=\"image.jpg\"` - Adds a `src` attribute with the value `image.jpg`\n",

      "Some attributes are global attributes and can be used on any HTML tag. Some attributes are specific to certain tags and can only be used with that tag. For example, the `href` attribute is a specific attribute for the `<a>` tag, and the `title` attribute is a global attribute that can be used on any HTML tag.\n",
      "### HTML5 attributes\n",
      "Some examples of HTML5 attributes are:\n",

      "  * `<header>` - Header\n",
      "  * `<footer>` - Footer\n",

      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "You don‚Äôt need to do a PhD in HTML to be a web developer. You just need to know the basics and get out of here ASAP. HTML5 just adds a few new tags and attributes to HTML. Rest all the stuff like Web APIs (local storage, session storage, etc.) are just JavaScript stuff. You can learn them later.\n",

    "**Q: What are the primitive data types in C++ according to ChaiCode documentation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: According to the ChaiCode C++ documentation, primitive data types are the basic data types used to define what type of data a variable can hold. The main primitive data types in C++ include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Primitive Data Types:**\n",
    "- `int`: Signed integer data type (values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)\n",
    "- `float`: Floating-point data type with 6 decimal places precision\n",
    "- `double`: Floating-point data type with 15 decimal places precision  \n",
    "- `char`: Character data type that holds a single character\n",
    "- `bool`: Boolean data type that holds either `true` or `false`\n",
    "- `void`: Used to indicate that a function doesn't return a value\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Primitive Data Types:**\n",
    "- `short`: Signed integer (-32,768 to 32,767)\n",
    "- `long`: Signed integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)\n",
    "- `long long`: Signed integer (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)\n",
    "- Various unsigned types like `unsigned char`, `unsigned short`, `unsigned int`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a practical example from the documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "#include<iostream>\n",
    "using namespace std;\n",
    "int main(){\n",
    "    int teaLeaves = 50;\n",
    "    float waterTemperature = 85.588588;\n",
    "    double priceOfTea = 299.99;\n",
    "    char teaGrade = 'A';\n",
